No real update here for a while! Major events include: 

 * Publication of our [social chromosome paper in Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11832.html)
 * BBSRC & NESCent funding to [crowdsource gene curation](http://afra.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk)
 * Google Summer of Code funding to help [identify problematic gene predictions](https://github.com/monicadragan/GeneValidator)
 * Support form the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk)
 * [Lots of teaching](/teaching/)
 * Some wonderful new [team members](/team.html), visitors, colleagues & collaborators.

Perhaps hope for more regular updates in 2014? We'll see.
