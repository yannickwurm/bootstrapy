Jakartans use "fogger" chemical sprays to fight dengue-transmitting _Aedes_ mosquitoes.

Whatever was meant to target the mosquitoes made cockroaches jumped into our swimming pool and drown themselves, and made "normal" ants frantically run in circles. This suggests that **whatever they use for fogging is a generalist poison that screws up all insect brains and likely affects larger things as well**. That is bad for controlling dengue, because many small animals compete with the mosquitos for food and reproductive space, or may even eat them (eg: larvae from other insects, or chick-chacks).




Probably for these reasons, fogging for dengue is **not** advised:






  * [The World Health Organization's (WHO) Indonesia Newsletter  (2008) states ](http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/News_Letters_Ino-September-October-08.pdf)_["Fogging has been proven over 50 years of use to have no practical effect on dengue transmission"](http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/News_Letters_Ino-September-October-08.pdf)_


  * [A study in the Singapore Medical Journal (2005) concluded that "_usual chemical fogging in natural environment was ineffective in breaking the reproductive lifecycle by eliminating gravid female _Aedes_ mosquitoes_"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16228097)


  * The Philippino government's Department of Health advises against fogging. [[here](http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20100908-291126/DOH-Clean-surroundings-a-better-response-to-dengue)] and [[here](http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20070703-74542/Dengue_fogging_not_advisable_%97_DOH-7)].




**So please stop fogging!**




 




The best approach is to eliminate all possible breeding sites: getting rid of even small amounts of stagnant water (in containers, trash, leaves, flower pot dishes....)
