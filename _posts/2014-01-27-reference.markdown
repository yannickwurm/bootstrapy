If you need a reference letter from me, I need you to write a first draft. First, you are best positioned to know what makes you great for what you're applying for. Second, you'll end up with a better letter if my time is spent revising something than if I try to create something from scratch. 

Your draft should in the form of a letter from me about you (yes, it can feel awkward to write like this). You basically need to say that you are a great and justify why). Some general tips: 

* Please respect the style guidelines given by <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/020530902X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=020530902X&linkCode=as2&tag=yannickwurm-21">Strunk & White's "The Elements of Style"</a>.  Keep it concise. 
* Use a spell-checker and a grammar-checker (on strict mode!).
* It's better if the examples you use are relevant to the degree you're applying to.
* Don't highlight weaknesses. E.g. if you have a "C" in something don't mention it. 
* Whatever you do, don't lie. Any lies will come back to hurt you 1000-fold (karma). 
* Send it as a document I can edit (not a PDF).


### Structure 

Introductory paragraph. This should include: 

 * Why I am writing
 * Why I know you well (eg. I am your advisor/supervisor).
 * Which degree you are doing and when you are expected to graduate. 
 * The last sentence should be a small list of ideas (see below), summarizing why you are great for the opportunity you're applying to. This also announces the structure of the next few paragraphs.


One paragraph per idea (no ping-ponging back and forth!). Some examples of ideas: 

 * evidence that you are serious & hardworking  (e.g., based on your project)
 * academic achievements (e.g., coursework or overall grades, your perception of your final grade ("first?"))
 * extra-curricular activities (jobs, volunteering)
 * evidence that you're a kind person (helping others). 

Conclusion: a quick summary stating that you're great for the degree/program/job because of the 3 or 4 ideas.
