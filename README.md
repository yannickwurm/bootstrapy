## How this works

* Edit your files in place (eg. index.html, team.html) or write a new post.
   Use `rake newpost[post-name]` to create a new post in the _posts folder with the name "post-name".

* run `rake translit` to transliterate any weird chars. (no longer necessary becasue we change the locale)

*  `rake build` creates the site in _site.
